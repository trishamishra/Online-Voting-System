IMPORTANT POINTS -
01. NO VALIDATIONS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED TO ENSURE THAT REQUESTS VIA, FOR EG.,
    POSTMAN ARE VALID.
02. CONCURRENCY HASN'T BEEN CONSIDERED, AND THE APP HAS BEEN BUILT ASSUMING THAT
    ONLY ONE PERSON WILL BE USING IT AT ANY GIVEN TIME.
03. HERE, VOTE IS ITS OWN MODEL, WHEREAS CANDIDATE ISN'T (AND IS DIRECTLY
    EMBEDDED INSIDE POLL).
    ACTUALLY, BOTH ARE SIMILAR AND BOTH COULD'VE BEEN THEIR OWN MODELS, OR BOTH
    COULD'VE BEEN DIRECTLY EMBEDDED INSIDE POLL.
04. IN THE ER DIAGRAM, MAKE 4 ENTITIES - POLL, USER (IS-A VOTER/ORGANISER),
    CANDIDATE, VOTE.
05. AFTER AN EDIT, THE VOTES CORRESPONDING TO THOSE CANDIDATES WHICH HAVE BEEN
    DELETED AUTOMATICALLY GET DELETED.
    SIMILARLY, AFTER AN EDIT, ONLY THOSE VOTES REMAIN WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE BY
    THE CURRENTLY ELIGIBLE VOTERS, AND ALL OTHER VOTES AUTOMATICALLY GET
    DELETED.
06. A CANDIDATE CAN ONLY BE DELETED BY SELECTING THE DELETE? CHECKBOX.
    CHANGING THE TITLE, DESCRIPTION OR IMAGES, BUT NOT SELECTING THE DELETE?
    CHECKBOX, DOESN'T REPLACE THE CANDIDATE, AS THE CORRESPONDING VOTES OF THAT
    CANDIDATE STILL REMAIN.
    SIMILARLY, IF THE DELETE? CHECKBOX HAS BEEN SELECTED, THEN THAT CANDIDATE
    GETS DELETED EVEN IF THE TITLE, DESCRIPTION OR IMAGES HAVE BEEN CHANGED.
07. ON BOTH THE NEW PAGE AND THE EDIT PAGE, IT MUST BE ENSURED THAT AT LEAST 2
    CANDIDATES ARE ADDED, AND IF ANYONE_CAN_VOTE IS FALSE, THEN AT LEAST 1 VOTER
    IS ADDED.
    ALSO, IT MUST BE ENSURED THAT EMPTY/DUPLICATE VOTERS AREN'T ADDED.
08. AFTER AN EDIT, IF MULTIPLE_VOTES_ALLOWED IS CHANGED, THEN ALL EXISTING VOTES
    AUTOMATICALLY GET DELETED.
    SIMILARLY, AFTER AN EDIT, IF ORGANISER_CAN_VOTE IS CHANGED TO FALSE, THEN
    THE ORGANISER'S VOTES (IF ANY) AUTOMATICALLY GET DELETED.
09. ALSO, IT MUST BE ENSURED THAT EMPTY VOTES AREN'T SUBMITTED.
10. AFTER A POLL HAS BEEN CONCLUDED, IT CANNOT BE EDITED AND THE CORRESPONDING
    VOTES CANNOT BE DELETED.
11. IF ONGOING_POLL_RESULTS_VISIBLE IS FALSE, THEN 'RESULTS' AND 'ALL VOTES'
    WILL NOT BE SHOWN FOR ONGOING POLLS, IRRESPECTIVE OF THE VALUE OF
    ANONYMOUS_VOTES.
